This is the fuel tracker that help user to know their vehicle efficiency .
it help them to improve the vechile condition .
here i used the concept of variable and data type checking concept to validate whether the user enter the valid input .
and i used the nested if...else for conditional statement.
use the looping concept of while that is while True in the beginning of code this make the user to try multiple log of tracking.
if they give no this will end .
